...

- **5** &middot; Let's start at the middle of the scale. A five is the epitome of mediocrity --- not bad, but also nothing exceptional. This is the score I would give to a record that's decent but doesn't particularly stand out in any way.

- **4** &middot; Four stands for "forgettable". Music with this rating is average at best, and I probably wouldn't listen to it again if given the choice.

- **3** &middot;

- **2** &middot;

- **1** &middot;

- **0** &middot;

- **6** &middot; Back in the realm of good music now, a six is what I would give to records that have a few good songs but are just above average overall.

- **7** &middot;

- **8** &middot;

- **9** &middot;

- **10** &middot;
