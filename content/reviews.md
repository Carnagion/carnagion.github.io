Welcome to my music blog!

Unlike my [main blog](/blog), which is reserved for long-form writings, I primarily use this blog to talk about and review the music I come across.

I mainly listen to progressive metal and rock, technical death metal, power metal, and pop punk, so most of my reviews here focus on works in those genres. That said, I occasionally get non-metal music recommendations from people I know, in which case I might review them too.
