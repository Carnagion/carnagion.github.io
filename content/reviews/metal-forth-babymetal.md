My first review (:partying_face:)! And incidentally also the first BABYMETAL album I've listened to completely, from start to finish.

It's hard to find a flaw with this album, to be honest. Every track is unique and I enjoyed them all, especially "White Flame ー白炎ー" (I definitely wasn't expecting a DragonForce-esque song). There were a few --- like "Song 3" and "Kon! Kon!" --- that took more than a single listen to appreciate, but I will admit they grew on me rather quickly.

Perhaps my least favourite track (as of writing this) is "My Queen", the one featuring Spiritbox, though I'm mostly convinced that it's because I'm not accustomed to their specific musical style yet. I might give it a few more listens. Anyways, really good album.
