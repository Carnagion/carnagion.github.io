Welcome to my blog!

I try to write semi-regularly. If I haven't posted anything in a while, then I'm probably busy with university, procrastinating a post that's been sitting as a draft for months, or just out of ideas.

As a side note: this blog is a part of [The Writing Gaggle](https://www.catmonad.xyz/writing_group/), a small writing group whose members motivate each other to write more.
