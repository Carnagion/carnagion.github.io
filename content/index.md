Hello there! :wave: I'm Indraneel,[^pronounciation] a computer scientist, programmer, and musician. I recently graduated from the [University of Nottingham](https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/) with a degree in computer science and artificial intelligence, and am currently employed in Switzerland üá®üá≠.

## Interests

My current interests lie mainly in the fields of optimisation (the mathematical kind), metaheuristics and hyperheuristics, machine learning, programming language and compiler design, and type theory.

I've worked on various challenging problems within these areas --- like my [Y3 undergraduate dissertation](https://github.com/Carnagion/dissertation) on integrated runway sequencing and de-icing, [Y4 undergraduate dissertation](https://github.com/Carnagion/plagiarism-detection) on plagiarism and LLM detection, and my university's research on [OPM-MEG (Magnetoencephalography with Optically Pumped Magnetometers)](https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/research/groups/spmic/research/meg-and-opm.aspx), for which I developed a metaheuristic-based multivariable optimisation method to calibrate magnetic sensors.

When I'm not engrossed in programming or work I'm usually reading, gaming, or listening to music --- some of my favourite genres include prog metal, power metal, death metal, and pop punk, to name a few. I regularly review albums I've listened to [here](/reviews). I also play the electronic keyboard, guitar, and (electric) bass.

## Projects

I've worked on various projects over the years, most of which are open-source. Here are some of my favourites, in no particular order:

- [`heur`](https://github.com/Carnagion/heur), a Rust library implementing a flexible, zero-cost combinator-based approach to constructing metaheuristics, inspired by parser combinators and iterators.

- [My year 3 undergraduate dissertation](https://github.com/Carnagion/dissertation) on *integrated runway sequencing and de-icing*, a novel runway scheduling approach yielding significant reductions in flight delays even for highly busy airports such as London Heathrow.

- [My year 4 undergraduate dissertation](https://github.com/Carnagion/plagiarism-detection) on source code plagiarism detection and LLM usage detection using statistical analyses to estimate the probability of independence of any two source code instances.

- [`lamb`](https://github.com/Carnagion/lamb), a Rust library for the untyped lambda calculus, supporting various Œ≤-reduction strategies in a generic manner and offering macros for convenient construction of terms in code.

Most of my projects are open-source and hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/Carnagion).

## Blog

I mainly write about things relating to my fields of interest, including interesting projects I've come across or worked on, as well as the occasional cool idea that pops into my head. All my blog posts are available [here](/blog).

## Contact

You can find me via:

- [Discord](https://discord.com/users/carnagion), where I go by the username `carnagion`,
- [GitHub](https://github.com/Carnagion), as `Carnagion` again,
- or email, at [`indraneel.mahendrakumar@gmail.com`](mailto:indraneel.mahendrakumar@gmail.com).

Out of the above, I'll respond the quickest on Discord. I'll probably be hanging around the [Rust Programming Language Community Server](https://discord.com/invite/rust-lang-community) (RPLCS), where I often help beginners and get into pointless debates with strangers on the internet.
