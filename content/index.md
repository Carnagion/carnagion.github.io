Hello there! :wave: I'm Indraneel [^pronounciation], a computer scientist, programmer, and musician. I'm currently a final-year computer science and artificial intelligence student at the [University of Nottingham](https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/).

## Interests

My current interests lie mainly in the fields of optimisation (the mathematical kind), metaheuristics and hyperheuristics, machine learning, programming language and compiler design, and type theory.

I enjoy working on challenging problems in these areas — like my [undergraduate dissertation](https://github.com/Carnagion/dissertation) on integrated runway sequencing and de-icing, or my university's research on [OPM-MEG (Magnetoencephalography with Optically Pumped Magnetometers)](https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/research/groups/spmic/research/meg-and-opm.aspx), for which I developed a metaheuristic-based multivariable optimisation method to calibrate magnetic sensors.

When I'm not engrossed in programming or university work I'm usually playing a video game or listening to music — I'm a big fan of progressive rock and metal. I also play the electronic keyboard, guitar, and bass.

## Projects

I've worked on various projects over the years, most of which are open-source. Here are some of my favourites, in no particular order:

- [`heur`](https://github.com/Carnagion/heur), a Rust library implementing a flexible, zero-cost combinator-based approach to constructing metaheuristics, inspired by parser combinators and iterators.

- [My undergraduate dissertation](https://github.com/Carnagion/dissertation) on *integrated runway sequencing and de-icing*, a novel runway scheduling approach yielding significant reductions in flight delays even for highly busy airports such as London Heathrow.

- [`lamb`](https://github.com/Carnagion/lamb), a Rust library for the untyped lambda calculus, supporting various β-reduction strategies in a generic manner and offering macros for convenient construction of terms in code.

You can view more of my projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/Carnagion).

## Blog

I mainly write about things relating to my fields of interest, including interesting projects I've come across or worked on, as well as the occasional cool idea that pops into my head. All my blog posts are available [here](/blog).

## Contact

You can find me via:

- [Discord](https://discord.com/users/carnagion), where I go by the username `carnagion`
- [GitHub](https://github.com/Carnagion), as `Carnagion` again
- or email, at [`indraneel.mahendrakumar@gmail.com`](mailto:indraneel.mahendrakumar@gmail.com)

Out of the above, I'll likely respond the quickest on Discord. I'll probably be hanging around the [Rust Programming Language Community Server](https://discord.com/invite/rust-lang-community) (RPLCS), where I often spend my time helping beginners and getting into pointless debates with strangers on the internet.
