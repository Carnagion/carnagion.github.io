# Indraneel Mahendrakumar

Hello there! ðŸ‘‹
I'm Indraneel, a second-year computer science student and mentor at the [University of Nottingham](https://www.nottingham.ac.uk).

I develop and maintain various libraries in my free time - such as [Jabberwock](https://github.com/Carnagion/jabberwock), the static site generator with which this website was made.
I'm also the author of [Modot](https://github.com/Carnagion/Modot) and [GDSerializer](https://github.com/Carnagion/GDSerializer), a mod loader and serialization framework respectively for [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org).
