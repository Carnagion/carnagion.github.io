# Projects

I've worked on a variety of programs and libraries, ranging from simple Discord bots and [websites](https://github.com/Carnagion/carnagion.github.io) to more complex ones like game [mods](https://github.com/Carnagion/ImprovedInsectoids), [mod loaders](https://github.com/Carnagion/Modot), and [programming language interpreters](https://github.com/Carnagion/lamb).
Most of my projects are completely open-source and can be viewed on [GitHub](https://github.com/Carnagion).
