# Haskell-Matrices

**Haskell-Matrices** is a small matrix library I implemented in Haskell, mainly as a challenge and fun programming exercise for myself as I was learning Haskell at the time.

It supports most basic matrix operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, finding the inverse, finding the determinant, finding the rank, and so on.
It is also capable of using [Gaussian elimination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_elimination) to solve a system of linear equations represented as a matrix.
