# IsleWard Addon Settings Framework

*February 2022* **Â·** [GitHub](https://github.com/Carnagion/IsleWard-AddonSettingsFramework)

**Addon Settings Framework** is a client-side addon for [IsleWard](https://play.isleward.com), serving as a settings menu framework for other addons.

It began as a small JavaScript file of shared functions for my other **IsleWard** addons, and I eventually released it as a full library.
