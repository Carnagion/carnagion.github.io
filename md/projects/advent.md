# Advent of Code

*December 2021 - Present* **Â·** [GitHub](https://github.com/Carnagion/AdventOfCode)

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) is a programming challenge that occurs every December.

I first began in 2021, when my university had set up a local leaderboard for it - and since then, I have found it a very enjoyable activity.
The problems each require different ways of approaching them, and the exposure to different kinds of challenges has significantly improved my programming skills.

These are the years I have taken part in, along with the language(s) I used for them:
- **2021**: C#
- **2022**: Haskell, Rust, Lean
