# Improved Insectoids

**Improved Insectoids** is a [RimWorld](https://rimworldgame.com) mod that enhances and expands upon insectoid-related gameplay.

The mod is mainly a remake of my first two **RimWorld** mods, [Breedable Insects](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2448466594) and its patch, [Tameable VFEI Insects](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2462829437), which aimed at making **RimWorld**'s insects more similar to the rest of its animals regarding animal husbandry.
I wanted to revisit the mods to see what I could improve and what new features I could add - the originals were made using pure XML as I did not know how to program at the time.

After the creation of **Improved Insectoids**, I took an indefinite break from creating **RimWorld** mods, though I still maintain all of them in a usable state.
